With the help of the Attribution Generator you may generate legally valid licence conform attributions for images residing on Wikimedia Commons or, in general, for an image used in Wikipedia.
You may paste or enter the web address of an image into the input box. Alternatively, you may drop a picture via Drag&Drop onto the input box. Submitting the web address of a Wikipedia article will allow selecting a particular image from all images used on the referenced article.
The application primarily supports Creative-Commons licenced creations. If no supported licence is detected, the application will display a note accordingly.
